gmetric-scripts
===============

Repository of Gmetric scripts created and used by NetAngelS

These are simple as possible scripts to gather metrics for varios servers and send to ganglia via gmetric.
Idea is to be minimalistic and gather only useful information.

Some scripts require authentication.
Please make sure that these parameters are set correctly for your environment.
